        <h4>Accountability</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The collapse of good conscience and the absence of accountability
            and public scrutiny have led to crimes against humanity and
            violations of international law. Rally, Bloemfontein, South Africa,
            25 February 1990 There is an absence of democratic accountability
            and control in every sphere of government and the state.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is an absence of democratic accountability and control in
            every sphere of government and the state. To address this
            debilitating legacy requires determined action and a deep commitment
            to transforming our society from a crisis ridden present into
            something all South Africans can be truly proud of. International
            Press Institute Congress, Cape Town, South Africa, 14 February 1994
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Achievements</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Our achievements, however we know full well, must not be used as an
            excuse for exaggerating our success or for ignoring errors committed
            and weakness that require urgent attention. From an article
            published in Africa South volume 6.1, October-December 1961
          </li>
          <li>
            We must always remain modest about our achievements. Fortieth
            anniversary of the establishment of Umkhonto we Sizwe, Soweto,
            Johannesburg, South Africa, 16 December 2001
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Aids</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Aids is a major problem to be tackled by the entire world. To deal
            with it requires resources far beyond the capacity of one
            continent.No single country has the capacity to deal with it. From a
            notebook, December 1991
          </li>
          <li>
            The fight against Aids is one of the greatest challenges the world
            faces at the start of the 21st century. Closing ceremony of the 15th
            international Aids conference, Bangkok, Thailand, 16 July 2004
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Education</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. 
            Address at the Planetarium , Johannesburg , South Africa , 16 July 2003</li>
          <li>No child in Africa and in fact anywhere in the world should be denied education. I know that we can reach this goal. 
            Launch of the Dream For Africa international fund raising campaign, Cape Town, South Africa, 6 December 2004</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Courage</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>I learnt that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. I felt fear myself more times than I can remember,
             but I hid it behind a mask of boldness. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, 
             but he who conquers the fear. From Long Walk to Freedom, 1994
          </li>
          <h4>Death</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>I would like it to be said that, “here lies a man who has done his duty on earth”.
               That is all. From the MSNBC documentary Headliners and Legends, 2006
            </li>
          </ul>
          </ul>
